            <h1>Hello! Good to have you here.</h1>
            <p>My name is Ninke and I'm 23 years old. I work for one of the start-ups selected to join the 5th Academy. I'm responsible for the marketing and communications of <a href="https://www.cally.com">Cally</a> and our Dutch platform Datumprikker. We make and continually develop a planningtool, so people can easily organize their fun getaways and business meetings. Our wish is to expand our territory and try to be succesfull outside of the Netherlands, where we just crossed the milestone of 9 million created events.</p>
  <h2>What describes you best in 5 words?</h2>
<p>I asked some people around me, because I don't really like answering these questions myself. So, they came up with: kind, smart, open-minded, assertive and ambitious.  </p>
  <h2>One sentence to describe you a bit more...</h2>
<p>Well, I think that's very difficult to put in one sentence. I would say that I'm impatient and don't like people who walk fast (because I'm only 5"2).</p>
<h2>Your main motivation for joining the Tribe?</h2>
       <p>As a starting marketing professional, but earger to learn, I experienced that the words 'Growth Hacking' where never mentioned in school, when I realised what it actually was I felt like I had missed one of the most important things in my education. My company happily applied at the Growth Tribe and made it my life works to be able to join this project and convice them I could do this. So here I am and ready to rumble!</p>
 <h2>What makes you unique?</h2>
            <p>You're asking me to answer an impossible question. So I asked the one who knows me best: "Your freckles after you've been in the sun for 10 minutes. But honestly, you're straightforward and feisty." - the boyfriend.</p>
